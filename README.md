# WebAssembly Benchmark ðŸ–¥

This project resembles an implementation of several algorythms and scenarios that try to compare benchmark perfoemance between JavaScript and WebAssembly (implemented via AssemblyScript).

Currently implemented algorythms:

- A variety of sorting algorythms
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Vosualization of the Mandelbrot Set

... looking to implement more algorythms in the future.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate into the wasm-directories (primes and sorting)

```
cd ./src/sorting/
// &
cd ./src/primes/
```

3. Install assembly-script dependencies

```
npm install

or

yarn install
```

4. Build the WASM-binaries once

```
npm run asbuild

or

yarn asbuild
```

## Run the project

To run the project you can either use the live server extension for VSCode, open the index.html in your web browser of choice or use the http-server runtime in the root directory of this project via npm:
