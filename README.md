# Sorting Algorythms ðŸ–¥

This project enables comparison and benchmarking of different sorting algorithms implemented in JavaScript and WebAssembly (via AssemblyScript).

Currently supported algorythms:

- Bubble Sort
- Shell Sort
- Radix Sort
- Counting Sort

... looking to implement more algorythms in the future.
